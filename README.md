 <h2 align="center">üìãAboutüìã</h2>
This application is designed to display random jokes fetched from the https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/ API. The app has two main screens - Today and History.

The Today screen displays the joke of the current day, which is fetched from the API. If a new day has started, the app automatically fetches a new joke from the API and displays it on the Today screen.

The History screen displays a list of all the jokes that have been fetched and saved by the app. The app saves the jokes using the asyncStorage.

The app also allows users to Like jokes by clicking a Like button. The Like feature uses asyncStorage to store the liked jokes, and the Like status is displayed on both the Today and History screens.
